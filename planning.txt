hmmmmmmmmmmm


how will this work?

chat bot: input = artist name

then grab all lyrics for artist. let's start there


ok..... we're going to have to add artists to our repitorire in mongo

limit to 100 songs per artist.


More refined:

Chat Bot Commands:
 /randLyric Baby Keem
	(Checks if artist exists in DB, if not, exit, else: aggregate Artist then $sample 1 lyric; return lyric)
 /addArtist Baby Keem 
	(Checks if artist exists in DB, if so, exit, else: stores N rows of Artist:Lyric key:value pairs)


Even more refined:
 /addArtist Baby Keem
	(if not mymongo.check_if...("Baby Keem"): myartist.populate_lyrics_for_artist(); mymongo.insert_values_under_key(...))



myartist = MyArtist(artist="Baby Keem", max_songs=1)
myartist.populate_lyrics_for_artist()

mymongo = MyMongo(client_string=
"mongodb+srv://atrony:Drt83711!@cluster0.avluf.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority")

mymongo.insert_values_under_key("genius","lyricsByArtist","lyric",myartist.lyrics_for_artist,"artist",myartist.artist_name)


ok we're done the chat bot.

Next step: Web app.
	First mode:
		Guess the song.
